Common options I need to know for now

1. Specify the C++ version or ISO standard version
    -std=c++11/14/11/20
    -std=gnu++11/14/17/20   //iso C++ with gnu extension
2. Verbosity: warning flags
    -Wall //turn on lots of compliler warning flags, this is just a set of
warnings, actually not all
    -Wextra //enable extra warning
    -Werror //every waring is treated as an error
3. Output file: -o <outputfile>
    g++ file.cpp -o file.bin
4. Optmization
    -O0 No optmization
    -O2/O3
    -OFast -> Enables higher level of optmization than -O3
5. Special Options
    -g -> Builds executable with debugging symbles for GNU/LLDB debbuger
    -c -> Compiler sources to object-code, which is input file for linker
